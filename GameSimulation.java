 * GameSimulation is the main entry point for the simulation.
 *
 * SOLID Applied:
 * - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This class sets up and runs the simulation but delegates responsibilities
 *   like score management, enemy management, and player actions to their respective classes.
 * - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Player class is constructed using the ScoreManager interface,
 *   making it independent of the specific implementation of score management.
