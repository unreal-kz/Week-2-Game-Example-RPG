/**
 * Player handles user interactions (e.g., defeating enemies).
 *
 * SOLID Applied:
 * - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This class is only responsible for player actions and interactions.
 * - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): It depends on the ScoreManager abstraction, not a concrete implementation.
 *   This allows for flexible substitution of different scoring strategies without modifying the Player class.
